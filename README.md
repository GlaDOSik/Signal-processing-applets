# Signal processing applets
I made these aplets for my bachelor thesis. They are supposed to be used as a learning material for signal processing class.  It was my first bigger Java project and I learned a lot about language and coding. That also means I wrote a lot of spaghetti code. Fortunately, my coding standards are higher today. It's an old project. And as we know, Google basically killed Java applets. You can still run them in IDE though (this is a NetBeans IDE project -> right mouse click on class -> Run File).
### Audio signal filtering (SoundF.java)
- dependent on JTransforms and JSyn libraries (not a part of this repository)

### Buffon's needle (Buffon.java)
### False color demonstration (FlsClr.java)
### Phasor theory (Fazory.java)
### Huffman coding (Huffman.java)
